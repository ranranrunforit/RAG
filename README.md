## RAG Projects


**[End-to-End RAG system](./End-to-End%20RAG%20system/README.md)**

The project focuses on factual question-answering (QA) specifically related to Pittsburgh and CMU. 
The system retrieves relevant documents and generates answers based on those documents. 
Large language models (LLMs) are used to enhance the knowledge base with relevant documents, 
improving the accuracy of answers related to history, culture, trivia, and upcoming events.
