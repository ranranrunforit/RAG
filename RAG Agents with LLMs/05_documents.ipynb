    "## **Part 1:** Chatting with Documents\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will begin a longer stream of discussion surrounding the use of LLMs to chat with documents. In a world where chat models are trained on giant repositories of public data and retraining them on custom data is prohibitively expensive, the idea of having an LLM reason about a set of PDFs or even a YouTube video opens up many opportunities!\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Your LLM can have a modifiable knowledge base grounded in human-readible documents,** meaning that you can directly control what kinds of data it has access to and can instruct it to interact with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Your LLM can sort through and pull references directly from your document set.** With sufficient prompt engineering and instruction-following priors, you can force your models to only act based on the material you provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Your LLM can possibly even interact with your documents, making automatic modifications as necessary.** This opens up avenues in automatic content refinement and synthetic operations which will be explored later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Listing out some possibilities is pretty easy, and from there you can let your imagination run wild... but we haven't gained the tools to do this quite yet, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Naive Approach: Stuff Your Document**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have some text documents (PDF, blog, etc.) and want to ask questions related to the contents of those documents. One approach you could try involves taking a representation of the document and feeding it all to a chat model! From a document perspective, this is known as [**document stuffing**](https://js.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/chains/document/stuff/).\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- > <img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=14DRI_uDviqzqg14TKoIc8IlBc3Zsb8oO\" width=800px/> -->\n",

    ">\n",
    "> From [**Stuff | LangChain**ü¶úÔ∏èüîó](https://js.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/chains/document/stuff/)\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This may very well work if your model is strong enough and if your document is short enough, but it shouldn't be expected to work well for an entire document. Many modern LLMs have significant trouble working with long contexts due to training limitations. Nowadays large model deterioration isn't quite as catastrophic, but good instruction following is likely to fall apart pretty quickly regardless of which model you use (assuming you're accessing the raw model).\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**The key issues you'll need to resolve with document reasoning are:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- How do we split our documents into pieces that can be reasoned with?\n",
    "\n",
    "- How can we find and consider these pieces efficiently as the size and number of documents increases?\n",
    "\n",
    "This course will explore several approaches to address these issues while continuing to build up our LLM orchestration skills. ***This notebook will serve to expand out our previous running chain skills for more progressive reasoning formulations, whereas the next notebooks will introduce some new techniques to properly address retrieval at scale.*** Through this experience, we will continue to leverage cutting-edge open-source solutions to make our solutions standard and integratable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speaking of, the field of document loading frameworks has many strong options, and two major players will come up throughout the course:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [**LangChain**](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction) provides a simple framework for connecting LLMs to your own data sources via general chunking strategies and strong incorporation with embedding frameworks/services. This framework has initially grown around its strong general support for LLM features, which signals its active strengths closer to the chain abstractions and agent coordination.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [**LlamaIndex**](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a data framework for LLM applications to ingest, structure, and access private or domain-specific data. It has since branched out to include general LLM capabilities similar to LangChain, but as of now it is still strongest in addressing the document side of LLM components since its initial abstractions were centered around that problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's recommended to read more about the unique strengths of both LlamaIndex and LangChain and pick the one that works best for you. Since LlamaIndex can be used *with* LangChain, the frameworks' unique capabilities can be leveraged together without too much issue. For the sake of simplicity, we will stick to LangChain in this course and will allow the [**NVIDIA/GenerativeAIExamples repository**](https://github.com/NVIDIA/GenerativeAIExamples/tree/main/RAG/notebooks) to explore deeper LlamaIndex options for those interested.\n"

    "## **Part 2:** Loading Documents\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain provides a variety of [document loaders](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/document_loaders) to facilitate the injestion of various document formats (HTML, PDF, code) from many different sources and locations (local storage, private s3 buckets, public websites, messaging APIs, etc.). These loaders query your data sources and return a `Document` object which contains the content and metadata, usually in a plain-text or otherwise human-readible format. There are plenty of document loaders already built and ready to use, with the first-party LangChain options listed [here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/document_loaders).\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this example, we can load a research paper of our choice using one of the following LangChain loaders:**\n",
    "- [`UnstructuredFileLoader`](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/document_loaders/unstructured_file): Generally-useful file loader for arbitrary files; doesn't make too many assumptions about your document structure and is usually sufficient.\n",
    "- [`ArxivLoader`](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/document_loaders/arxiv): A more specialized file-loader which can communicate with the Arxiv interface directly. [Just one example of many](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/document_loaders), this will make some more assumptions about your data to yield nicer parsings and auto-fill metadata (useful when you have multiple documents/formats).\n",
    "\n",
    "For our code example we will default to using `ArxivLoader` to load in one of either the [MRKL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00445) or [ReAct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) publication papers as you're likely to run into them at some point in your continued chat model research endeavors."

    "To automatically reason about large documents, one potential idea might be to use LLMs to create a dense summary or knowledge base. Similar to how we maintained a running history of the conversation via slot-filling in the previous notebook, is there any problem with keeping a running history of an entire document?\n",

Specifically, we'll be implementing a simple but useful Runnable that uses a while loop and the running state chain formulation to summarize a set of document chunks. This process is commonly known as [**\"document refinement\"**](https://js.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/chains/document/refine/) and is largely akin to our previous conversation-focused slot-filling exercise; the only difference is that now we're dealing with a large document instead of a growing chat history.\n",

    "Much like the `KnowledgeBase` class from the previous notebook, we can create a `DocumentSummaryBase` structure designed to encapsulate the essence of a document. The one below will use the `running_summary` field to query the model for a final summary while attempting to use the `main_ideas` and `loose_ends` fields as a bottleneck to keep the running summary from moving too fast. This is something we're going to have to enforce via prompt engineering, so the `summary_prompt` is also provided which shows how this information will be used. Feel free to modify it as necessary to make it work for your model of choice."

    "## **Part 5:** Synthetic Data Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "As we conclude our exploration of document summarization using LLMs, it's important to acknowledge the broader context and potential challenges. While we've demonstrated a viable method for extracting concise, meaningful summaries, let's consider why such an approach is crucial and the complexities it entails.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Generality of Refinement**\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that this \"progressive summarization\" technique is merely a starter chain that makes few assumptions about the initial data and desired output format. The same technique can be expanded far and wide to generate synthetic refinements with known metadata, active assumptions, and downstream objectives in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consider these potential applications:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Aggregating Data**: Constructing structures that transform raw data from document chunks into coherent, useful summaries.\n",
    "2. **Categorization and Sub-topic Analysis**: Creating systems that categorize insights from chunks into defined categories, tracking emerging sub-topics within each.\n",
    "3. **Consolidation into Dense Informational Chunks**: Refining these structures to distill insights into compact segments, enriched with direct quotes for deeper analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "These applications hint at the creation of a **domain-specific knowledge graph** which can be accessed and traversed by a conversational chat model. Some utilities already exist to generate these automatically via tools like [**LangChain Knowledge Graphs**](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/graph/). Though you might need to develop hierarchical structures and tools to both construct and traverse such a structure, it is a viable option when you can properly refine a sufficient knowledge graph for your use case! For this intereted in more advanced knowledge graph construction techniques which rely on larger systems and vector similarity, we found the [**LangChain x Neo4j Article**](https://blog.langchain.dev/using-a-knowledge-graph-to-implement-a-devops-rag-application/) to be of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Addressing the Challenges of Large-Scale Data Processing**\n",
    "\n",
    "While our approach opens up exciting possibilities, it's not without its challenges, especially when dealing with large volumes of data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Generic Preprocessing Limitations**: While summarization is relatively straightforward, developing hierarchies that are universally effective across various contexts is challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Granularity and Navigation Costs**: Achieving detailed granularity in a hierarchy can be resource-intensive, requiring sophisticated consolidation or extensive branching to maintain manageable context sizes per interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dependency on Precise Instruction Execution**: Navigating such a hierarchy with our current tools would rely heavily on powerful instruction-tuned models with strong prompt engineering. The inference latency and the risk of errors in argument prediction can be significant, so using LLMs for this could be a challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you progress through the course, keep track of how these challenges get addressed with subsequent techniques. "
